## MITx: 6.00.2x Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science
The second part of a two-part course series offered by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on the edX platform. This course is designed to introduce students to the fundamental concepts of computational thinking and data science, and to provide them with practical experience in implementing and applying these concepts to real-world problems.


### Problem Set 1: Space Cows  & Transporting Space Cows

**Description:** This problem set involves using a greedy heuristic to determine an allocation of cows that attempts to minimize the number of spaceship trips needed to transport all the cows. The returned allocation of cows may or may not be optimal. The cow data is provided in the form of cow name (string), weight (int) pairs in `ps1_cow_data.txt`.

The greedy heuristic should follow the following method:

1. As long as the current trip can fit another cow, add the largest cow that will fit to the trip.
2. Once the trip is full, begin a new trip to transport the remaining cows.

Note that the greedy heuristic is not guaranteed to give the optimal solution, but it can provide a good approximation. 


### Problem Set 2: Simulating robots

**Description:**
- Involves simulating robots in a virtual world
Goal is to practice designing classes and methods, and using inheritance to create new classes.
- Build several classes such as Position, RectangularRoom, Robot, and StandardRobot
- Robot class is further subclassed to create RandomWalkRobot and AdaptiveWalkRobot
- Implement methods for moving the robot, cleaning the room, and measuring the performance of the robot in terms of how much of the room it is able to clean in a given time
- Provides the opportunity to practice object-oriented programming
- Learn how to design and implement simulations in Python.
   


##  Problem Set 3: Simulating the Spread of Disease and Virus Population Dynamics

**Description:**

Sure, here's a bullet-point description of MIT Problem Set 3 on Simulating the Spread of Disease and Virus Population Dynamics:

- The problem set involves using programming to simulate the spread of a virus in a population, and analyzing the population dynamics of the virus.
- The first part of the problem set focuses on implementing a simple virus transmission model, where individuals can be either susceptible, infected, or recovered from the virus. The model takes into account parameters such as the transmission rate and recovery rate.
- The second part of the problem set involves adding more complexity to the model, such as incorporating population demographics and the effects of social distancing measures.
The third part of the problem set requires analyzing the population dynamics of the virus over time, including calculating the basic reproduction number and examining the effects of varying parameters on the spread of the virus.
- The final part of the problem set asks students to reflect on the limitations of the model and consider how it could be improved or expanded upon.
Throughout the problem set, students are encouraged to think critically about the assumptions and limitations of the model, and to explore ways to make the model more realistic and applicable to real-world situations.






### Problem Set 4 : Regression  Problem

**Description:**

- The weather data regression model is built using real-world data for four cities: New York, San Francisco, Ann Arbor, and Beijing.
- For each city, the model uses historical weather data spanning several years, including daily average temperature, pressure, and wind speed, as well as daily high and low temperatures.
- The model is used to predict the temperature of each city on a given day, based on the historical weather data for that city.
- The model is evaluated using statistical metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared value to determine the accuracy of the predictions.
- The model provides insights into how weather patterns and temperature vary across different cities, and can be used to make informed decisions about travel or outdoor activities.
